export const LANDING_TEXT = `We are a society which tries to raise the profile of the <b>ugly</b> animals
            of the world. We believe that fluffy, cute creatures of the world,
            such as the giant panda, get far too much attention in the modern media.
            Creatures like the naked mole rat, the spiny lumpsucker fish and the jumping spider deserve much
            more attention! Of course, <b>ugly</b> is subjective and might apply to lots of animals, too,
            but definitely not pandas, and blob fish are now considered pass√©, too.`
